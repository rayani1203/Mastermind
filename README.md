# Mastermind

Console version of a real board game where the player attempts to break a randomly generated code comprised of 4 unique digits from 1 to 6. After each guess at cracking the code, the user receives feedback on how many perfect/non-perfect guesses they made, information which can help them logically decipher the code. A matrix was also utilized to keep track of all past guesses and feedback to help the user easily keep track of all the information provided.
